They seem to be in the form <CMD NUM>7<CMD NUM> where the first number increments and the last number decrements.
I'll have to do some math to see if the Get Velocities command fits in this pattern. I'm too tired tonight.
I also wonder what the hypothetical first command (:000000017F) does. Hopefully, it's not the self destruct sequence.

: Starting char
xx String Number
xx Shot Number
xx Command
xx LRC of above byte excluding the ':'
Each command is returned by either an ACK message, the data requested, or a Nack message.
The data requested can be returned in several different formats depending on the command sent.
